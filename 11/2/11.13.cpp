/*
 * The 3 ways to create pairs are:
 * return {first, second} -- this option is very clear but only works in C++11 and on.
 * return pair<string, int> (first, second) -- this version is more explicit, works on all versions but is more verbous
 * return make_pair(first, second) -- this version feels to me the most clear also works on all versions and is not as verbous.
