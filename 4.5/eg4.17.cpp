#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // the prefix operators act upon the value and return it before the result is used in an expression
    // the postfix operators allow the value to be used in the expression and then increments it. Usage of this version in an expression where the incremented/decremented value is an operand to another operator may yield undefined results.
