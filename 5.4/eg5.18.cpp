#include <iostream>

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // a. creates 2 int variables, takes the input and saves it in the variables, prints the sum, the while condition is incorrect however as the cin object can't be converted to boolean, the action of "downloading" the input into a variable can return a boolean value.
    // b. there should be no variable initialization within the do while body or head.
    // c. the ival is only available within the {} and since the while operator and condition are outside this will result in a compiler error.
