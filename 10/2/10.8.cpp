// the claim is not invalidated because the algorithm itself would not make changes to the container
// if the container had the required size and elements, the asignation would have been done over
// the denoted element values.
// the back_inserter is the iterator that instead of denoting and overwritting the contents of
// an element, it uses push_back to insert when the assignation = is used on it.
