// friends are used when we intend to provide access to the private members from outside the class declaration.
// friends functions are locations that we may need to look in case of bugs as well as changes to the private members.
// the pros of not using friends is that we localize the logic of the class within the class declaration making maintenance easy as well as bugs searching.
// there are situations however where a function is not to be part of the body and in that case the use of friends is handy to only frovide access to a limited number of functions.
