// The size they take on the memory and hence how high a an int number can go is defined by the types. Short is likely to be too small. 
// long is likely to be the same size as int based on compiler settings. So usage is between int and long long.
// signed characters have both positive and negative while unsigned only have positive numbers (>=0)
// the difference between float and double is the number of significant digits which are 6 and respectively 10 minimum. Compilers tend to have larger
// significant values than the minimums.
