/*
 * void f(T) is a function that has as argument a variable of type T the name of variable is also required. The function will initialise the variables before the control is passed to it.
 * The variable is passed by value which means that once initialised we will have a copy of the original value hence any changes to it won't affect the original variable.
 * void f(T&) will pass by reference a variable allowing the function to dirrectly act upon the value of the variable of type T.
